# TwistRods: Simulating the mechanics of rods with a twist

We are interested in solving the continuum mechanics of closed elastic rods with twist degrees of freedom (following the approach from _Bergou et al_) in Julia, and study their statistical properties under Langevin dynamics.

We are especially interested in topological observables, prompting us to work on closed rods.
